# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with Low-Rank Adaptation
# Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning large language models such as BERT and RoBERTa for specific downstream tasks by tweaking only a portion of the parameters. Traditional fine-tuning methods, which involve adjusting all the parameters, can be highly time-consuming. Instead, we employ the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to achieve comparable accuracy with significantly reduced computational time.

# Background
Large language models like BERT and RoBERTa have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by providing state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks often requires substantial computational resources and time due to the vast number of parameters.

# Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique that aims to reduce the number of parameters that need to be adjusted during the fine-tuning process. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, LoRA introduces low-rank parameter matrices that can be efficiently updated, significantly reducing the computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy.

# Advantages
Reduced Time: Fine-tuning with LoRA is much faster compared to traditional methods.
High Accuracy: LoRA achieves comparable accuracy to full fine-tuning.
Resource Efficiency: Less computational resources are required, making it accessible for broader applications.
